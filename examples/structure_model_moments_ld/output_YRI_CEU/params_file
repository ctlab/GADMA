#	It is a parameters file for GADMA software.

#	Lines started from # are ignored.
#	Also comments at the end of a line are ignored too.
#	Every line contains: Identificator of parameter : value.

#!!! 	means pay attention to this parameter, they are primary.

#!!!
#	Output directory to write all GADMA out.
#	One need to set it to a missing or empty directory.
#	If it is resumed from other directory and output directory 
#	isn't set, GADMA will add '_resumed' for previous output 
#	directory.
