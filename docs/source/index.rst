Welcome to GADMA's documentation!
=================================

GADMA implements methods for automatic inferring the joint demographic history of multiple populations from genetic data.

GADMA is based on two open source packages: `dadi <https://bitbucket.org/gutenkunstlab/dadi/>`_ developed by Ryan Gutenkunst and `moments <https://bitbucket.org/simongravel/moments/>`_ developed by Simon Gravel.

In contrast, **GADMA is a command-line tool**. It presents a series of launches of the genetic algorithm and infers demographic history from the Allele Frequency Spectrum of multiple populations (up to three).
