#	It is a parameters file for GADMA software.

#	Lines started from # are ignored.
#	Also comments at the end of a line are ignored too.
#	Every line contains: Identificator of parameter : value.

#!!! 	means pay attention to this parameter, they are primary.

#!!!
#	Output directory to write all GADMA out.
#	One need to set it to a missing or empty directory.
#	If it is resumed from other directory and output directory 
#	isn't set, GADMA will add '_resumed' for previous output 
#	directory.
Output directory : 


#!!!
#	Input file can be sfs file (should end with .fs) or 
#	file of SNP's in dadi format (should end with .txt).
Input file : 

#	'Population labels' is sequence of population names (the same
#	names as in input file)
#	If .fs file is in old format then it would rename population 
#	labels that are absent.
#	It is necessary to put them in order from most ancient to less. 
#	(In case of more than two populations)
#	It is important, because the last of formed populations take
#	part in the next split.
#	For example, if we have YRI - African population,
#	CEU - European population and CHB - Chinese population,
#	then we can write YRI, CEU, CHB or YRI, CHB, CEU 
#	(YRI must be at the first place)
#	Default: from input file
Population labels :  

#	Also one can project your spectrum to less size.
#	For example, we have 80 individuals in each of three 
#	populations, then spectrum will be 81x81x81 and one can 
#	project it to 21x21x21 by set 'Projections' parameter 
#	to 20, 20, 20.
#	Default: from input file
Projections : 

#!!!
#	Are SNP's linked or unlinked?
#	If they are linked, then Composite Likelihood Akaike
#	Information Criterion (CLAIC) will be used to compare models.
#	If they are unlinked, then usual Akaike Information Criterion 
#	(AIC) will be used.
#	Default: True
Linked SNP's : 

#!!!
#	If SNP's are linked in order to calculate CLAIC, please, set
#	the directory with bootstrapped data. 
#	Bootstrap should be done over the regions of the genome.
#	Default: None
Directory with bootstrap: 


#!!!
#	Now all main parameters:
#
#	Use moments or dadi
#	Default: moments
Engine : 

#	If you choose to use dadi, please set pts parameter - number
#	of points in the grid. Otherwise this pts would be used in dadi's code.
#	Default: Let n = max number of individuals in one population, 
#	then pts = n, n+10, n+20
Pts : 

#!!!
#	Print parameters of model in units of N_ref = N_A.
#	N_A will be placed in brackets at the end of string.
#	Default: False
Relative parameters : 

#	Total mutation flux - theta.
#	It is equal to:
#	theta = 4 * μ * L
#	where μ - mutation rate per site per generation and 
#	L - effective sequenced length, which accounts for losses 
#	in alignment and missed calls.
#	Note: one should estimate μ based on generation time.
#	Default: 1.0
Theta0 : 

#	Time (years) for one generation. Can be float. 
#	Is important for drawing models. If one don't want to draw, 
#	one can pass it.
#	Default: 1.0
Time for generation : 

#	Use sudden changes of population sizes only. Decreases 
#	the number of parameters.
#	Default: False
Only sudden : 

#	Disable migrations in demographic models.
#	Default: False
No migrations : 


#!!!
#	One should choose the demographic history to infer.
#	It can be custom or setted up with structure.

# 1. Using a custom demographic model.
#	Please specify a file with a function named 'model_func' in it. 
#	So file should contain:
#	def model_func(params, ns, pts) in case of dadi
#	or
#	def model_func(params, ns) in case of moments
#	Default: None
Custom filename : 

#	Now one should specify either bounds or identifications 
#	of custom model's parameters. All values are in Nref units.
#	Lower and upper bounds - lists of numbers.
#	List of usual bounds:
#	N: 1e-2 - 100
#	T: 0 - 5
#	m: 0 - 10
#	s: 0 - 1
#	These bounds will be taken automatically if identifications are set.
#	Default: None
Lower bound : 
Upper bound : 
#	An identifier list:
#	T - time
#	N - size of population
#	m - migration
#	s - split event,  proportion in which population size
#	is divided to form two new populations.
#	Default: None
Parameter identifiers : 

# 2. Structure is for not custom models!
#	Structure of model for one population - number of time periods 
#	(e.g. 5).
#	Structure of model for two populations - number of time periods
#	before the split of the ancestral population and after it (e.g. 2,2).
#	Structure of model for three populations - number of time periods
#	before first split, between first and second splits and after 
#	second split (e.g. 2,1,2).
#
#	Structure of initial model:
#	Default: all is ones - 1 or 1,1 or 1,1,1
Initial structure : 

#	Structure of final model:
#	Default: equals to initial structure
Final structure : 


#!!!
#	Local optimization.
#
#	Choice of local optimization, that is launched after 
#	each genetic algorithm.
#	Choices:
#
#	*	optimize (BFGS method)
#	
#	*	optimiza_log (BFGS method)
#	
#	*	optimize_powell (Powell’s conjugate direction method)
#	(Note: is implemented in moments: one need to have moments 
#	installed.)
#
#	(If optimizations are often hitting the parameter bounds, 
#	try using these methods:)
#	*	optimize_lbfgsb
#	*	optimize_log_lbfgsb 
#	(Note that it is probably best to start with the vanilla BFGS 
#	methods, because the L-BFGS-B methods will always try parameter
#	values at the bounds during the search. 
#	This can dramatically slow model fitting.)
#
#	*	optimize_log_fmin (simplex (a.k.a. amoeba) method)
#	
#	*	hill_climbing
#	
#	Default: optimize_powell
Local optimizer : 



#	Parameters of pipeline
#
#	One can automatically draw models every N iteration. 
#	If 0 then never.
#	Pictures are saved in GA's directory in the picture folder.
#	Default: 0
Draw models every N iteration : 

#	One can automatically generate dadi and moments code for models.
#	If 0 then only current best model will be printed in GA's 
#	working directory.
#	Also the result model will be saved there. 
#	If specified (not 0) then every N iteration model will be saved
#	in python code folder.
#	Default: 0
Print models' code every N iteration : 

#	One can choose time units in models' plots: years or thousand 
#	years (kya, KYA). If time for one generation isn't specified 
#	then time is in genetic units.
#	Default: years
Units of time in drawing : 

#	No std output.
#	Default: False
Silence : 

#	How many times launch GADMA with this parameters.
#	Default: 1
Number of repeats : 

#	How many processes to use for this repeats.
#	Note that one repeat isn't parallelized, so increasing number
#	of processes will not affect the time of one repeat.
#	It is desirable that the number of repeats is a multiple of 
#	the number of processes.
#	Default: 1
Number of processes : 



#	It is possible to limit the time of splits.
#	Split 1 is the most ancient split.
#	!Note that time is in genetic units (2 * time for 1 generation):
#	e.g. we want to limit by 150 kya, time for one generation is 
#	25 years, then bound will be 150000 / (2*25) = 3000.
#
#	Upper bound for split 1 (in case of 2 or 3 populations).
#	Default: None
Upper bound of first split : 

#	Upper bound for split 2 (in case of 3 populations).
#	Default: None
Upper bound of second split : 


#	One can resume from some other launch of GADMA by setting
#	output directory of it to 'Resume from' parameter.
#	You can set again new parameters of resumed launch.
Resume from : 
#
#	If you want to take only models from previous run set this 
#	flag.  Then iterations of GA will start from 0 and values of
#	mutation rate and strength will be initial.
#	Default: None
Only models :
